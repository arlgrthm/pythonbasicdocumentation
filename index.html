            <header>Why Choose Python</header>
            <p>
                <span>Readability and Simplicity </span> - Python is renowned for its clean and readable syntax. Its use of indentation for code blocks and straightforward, English-like keywords make it exceptionally user-friendly. This readability not only makes it an excellent language for beginners but also speeds up development for experienced programmers. With Python, you can write more code with fewer lines, enhancing productivity and reducing the likelihood of errors.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Versatility and Broad Application </span> - Python is incredibly versatile and finds applications in various domains. It's a popular choice for web development (Django, Flask), data analysis and machine learning (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn), scientific computing (SciPy), automation (scripting), and much more. Python's extensive standard library and a vast ecosystem of third-party packages ensure that you can find a solution for almost any programming task.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Community and Support </span> - Python boasts a vibrant and active community of developers and enthusiasts. This community contributes to a wealth of resources, including documentation, tutorials, forums, and libraries. Additionally, Python has a strong corporate backing, with companies like Google, Facebook, and Netflix using it extensively in their projects. This means that Python enjoys robust support and a bright future, with regular updates and improvements to the language.

            <header>Python Basic Syntax</header>
                <p>Python's syntax is known for its simplicity and readability. Here are some key elements of Python's basic syntax:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span> Indentation: </span> Python uses indentation (whitespace) to define code blocks, like loops and functions, instead of curly braces or keywords. Proper indentation is crucial for code to run correctly.</li>
                    <li><span> Variable: </span> Variables are created by assigning a value to a name. Python dynamically infers data types, so you don't need to specify them explicitly</li>
                    <pre class="code-block"><code class="language-python">
                        # in python, there is no need to specify the type of the variable
                        
                        x = 5    #this is an int
                        y = "John"   #this is a string
                        print(x)     
                        print(y)
                    </code></pre>
                    <li><span> Statements: </span> In Python, statements are individual lines of code that perform specific actions, such as assigning values to variables, controlling program flow with conditionals and loops, defining functions, and handling exceptions</li>
                    <pre class="code-block"><code class="language-python">
                        # Assignment Statement
                            number = 10;      # integer
                            pizza_flavor = "Ham and Cheese"   # string

                        # Print Statement
                            print('Hello World!')
                            print(number)

                        # Conditional Statement - Just a Preview
                            if x > 0:
                                print("Out of stock")
                            else: 
                                print("Available!")
                        
                        # Defining functions
                        def pizza_order(flavor, price):
                            print(flavor + " " + price)
                            # call it 
                            pizza_order()

        <section class="main-section" id="Python_Data_Types">
            <header>Python Data Types</header>
                <p>Python supports several built-in data types. Here is a list of some of the fundamental data types in Python.</p>
                <li><code>` int `</code> (Integer) - Represents whole numbers, e.g., 5, -10, 1000.</li>
                <li><code>` float `</code> (Floating number) - Represents decimal numbers, e.g., 3.14, 0.01, -2.5.</li>
                <li><code>` str `</code> (String) - Represents text, e.g., <code>"Hello, World!", 'Python'.</code></li>
                <li><code>` bool `</code> (Boolean) - Represents either True or False.</li>
                <li><code>` list `</code>Represents an ordered collection of elements, e.g.,<code>[1, 2, 3], ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']</code>.</li>
                <li><code>` tuple `</code> Similar to lists but immutable (cannot be modified after creation), e.g.,<code>(1, 2, 3), ('red', 'green', 'blue').</code>.</li>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Python_Control_Structures">
            <header>Python Control Structures</header>
                <p>Control structures in Python are fundamental building blocks that allow you to manage the flow and execution of your code. They enable you to make decisions, repeat actions, and define the order in which your program executes instructions. Python provides several control structures, including conditional statements (if-elif-else), loops (for and while), and more, which empower you to create flexible and dynamic programs that respond to various conditions and requirements.</p>
                <p>These are the examples:</p>
            <li><span>Conditional Statements (if-elif-else):</span>allow you to execute different blocks of code based on specified conditions.</li>
            <pre class="code-block"><code class="language-python">
            # if elif else
                age = 18
                if age < 18:
                    print("You are a minor.")
                elif age == 18:
                    print("You are just 18 years old.")
                else:
                    print("You are an adult.")
            </code></pre>
            <li><span>Loops (for and while):</span>Loops enable you to repeat a block of code multiple times.</li>
            <pre class="code-block"><code class="language-python">
                # Using a for loop to iterate through a list
                fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
                for fruit in fruits:
                    print("I like", fruit)
                
                # Using a while loop to count from 1 to 5
                count = 1
                while count <= 5:
                    print(count)
                    count += 1
                
            </code></pre>
            <li><span>Break and Continue:</span>break is used to exit a loop prematurely, and continue is used to skip the current iteration and move to the next.</li>
            <pre class="code-block"><code class="language-python">
                for num in range(1, 11):
                if num == 5:
                break  # Exit the loop when num equals 5
                    print(num)

                for num in range(1, 11):
                    if num % 2 == 0:
                    continue  # Skip even numbers
